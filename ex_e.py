# TODO 1 Calculating the Factors of an Integer
#        When a nonzero integer, a, divides another integer, b, leaving a remainder 0, a is said to be a factor of b
#        As an example, 2 is a factor of all even integers hence e.g. is_factor(2, 8) should return True


# TODO 2 Using is_factor function write another function print_factors(n) which prints for n = 20
#      2 is a factor of 20
#      4 is a factor of 20
#      5 is a factor of 20
#      10 is a factor of 20
